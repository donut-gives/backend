## Conventions ðŸ¤Œ
* Branch Naming - braches should be named in snake_case with following tags separated by '/' at the start:
  * **feat** - indicating a new feature has been implemented in this branch
  * **fix** - indicating a bug fix implemented or a feature updated with fix
  * **ref** - indicating a refactor of directories, files, names etc.
  * **hot** - indicating hotfixes on branches branched from prod. These branches should be merged in prod and main.
* File Naming - all files should be named in snake_case
* Dir Naming - all dirs should be named in snake_case
* Avoid using long names for branch names, file names, class names or public variables
