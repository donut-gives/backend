## Guidelines
* Branch Naming - braches should be named in snake_case with following tags separated by '/' at the start:
  * feat - indicating a new feature has been implemented in this branch
  * fix - indicating a bug fix implemented or a feature updated with fix
  * ref - indicating a refactor of directories, files, names etc.
  * hot - indicating hotfixes on branches branched from prod. These branches should be merged in prod and main.
* File Naming - all files should be named in snake_case
* Class Naming - all class should be named in UpperCamelCase.
* Variable Naming - all variables should be names in lowerCamelCase.
* Avoid using long names for branch names, file names, class names or public variables
